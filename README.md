# Quiz App

This Flutter project was made following the course "Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2024 Edition]", available in https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/.

## Description

In the third section of the course, the objective was diving deeper into the languages and learning more about some flutter widgets.

To accomplish that, a Quiz App was created, where the user would answer questions about the flutter language, picking one of four possible answer. After answering all the questions, the app shows a summary of how many questions you got right, and shows the correct answer to the questions you got wrong. You can also retry the quiz after doing it.
